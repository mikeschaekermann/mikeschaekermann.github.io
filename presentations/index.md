## CHI2016: Resolvable vs. Irresolvable Ambiguity

In May 2016, I presented a <a href="http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas02mg/HCML2016/HCML2016_paper_24.pdf" target="_blank">position paper</a> from our research group at the workshop on <a href="http://hcml2016.goldsmithsdigital.com/program/" target="_blank">Human-Centered Machine Learning</a> (HCML) at the <a href="https://chi2016.acm.org/" target="_blank">CHI2016</a> conference in San Jose. In this paper, we tackle the conventional assumption that, in supervised machine learning, ground truth data always needs to provide exactly one correct label per training example. We propose a new hybrid framework for dealing with uncertainty in ground truth that fully acknowledges the notion of irresolvable expert disagreement.

## Hacking Brain-Computer Interfaces

In March 2015, I had the pleasure to give a talk on brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Singularity-meets-Self-Improvement-in-Berlin/" target="_blank">"Singularity meets Self-Improvement" (SMSI) meetup</a> in Berlin which is regularly hosted by <a href="http://trent.st/publications/" target="_blank">AI researcher</a> and <a href="https://www.ascribe.io/" target="_blank">start-up founder</a> <a href="http://trent.st/" target="_blank">Dr. Trent McConaghy</a>. In this talk, the focus is on different ways of presenting, processing and analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) data, alleging some fun examples from real-world BCI applications. In addition to that, the open-source/open-hardware device <a href="http://openbci.com/" target="_blank">OpenBCI</a> is introduced and demonstrated.

## Implicit Surface Modeling for 3D Printing

In July 2015, the award-winning computer graphics experts at <a href="http://xymatic.com/" target="_blank">xy:matic</a> invited to the first-ever <a href="http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Berlin-WebGL-Meetup/">WebGL Meetup Berlin</a> at the time for which I was a speaker on the topic of implicit surface modeling for 3D printing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_surface">Implicit surfaces</a> are a traditional way of accurately representing the shape of complex 3D objects in space. This type of representation was neglected in the field of computer graphics for a long time due to insufficient computing capabilities in GPUs. Today, as GPUs have become increasingly powerful, implicit surfaces are flourishing again as representations of customizable objects for 3D printing.
