My research at the University of Waterloo, where I am supervised by <a href="https://hci.cs.uwaterloo.ca/faculty/elaw/" target="_blank">Dr. Edith Law</a> and <a href="http://www.acagamic.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Lennart Nacke</a>, is located at the intersection of (inter-)active machine learning, biosignal analysis and playful interaction. In particular, I am interested in exploring ways to apply active learning paradigms to the problem of time series classification for making annotation tasks on large datasets more accurate and cost effective.

My focus in this endeavor is currently on the domain of electrophysiological biosignal time series, such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) as these signals contain valuable information for various fields of research. Two of these fields are [neurology]({{site.url}}/projects/#crowdeeg) and [games user research]({{site.url}}/projects/#collaborative-biosignal-and-gameplay-analysis) for which I aim to create useful applications in the course of authoring my Master's thesis.
