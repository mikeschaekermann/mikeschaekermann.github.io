## crowdEEG

Framework to combine machine and human intelligence for the scalable and accurate analysis of human clinical EEG recordings.
<a href="https://github.com/edithlmlaw/crowdeeg-viewer" target="_blank">CrowdEEG</a> is an active research project in professor <a href="https://hci.cs.uwaterloo.ca/faculty/elaw" target="_blank">Edith Law's</a> <a href="https://hci.cs.uwaterloo.ca/faculty/elaw/people.html" target="_blank">CrowdLab</a> at the University of Waterloo. I am currently conducting a study investigating the effects of implicit contextual information on the agreement rates among experts in a sleep staging task. The goal of the study is to identify such contextual dependencies and make them explicit for crowdworkers to be used in a similar crowdsourcing task.

The CrowdLab will also be represented at this year's <a href="https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/" target="_blank">CHI 2016</a> workshops on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/teevan/misc/microproductivity/" target="_blank">Microproductivity</a> by <a href="http://acw.io/" target="_blank">Alex C. Williams</a> and on <a href="http://hcml2016.goldsmithsdigital.com/" target="_blank">Human-Centered Machine Learning</a> by myself with the following two paper submissions:

## Collaborative Biosignal and Gameplay Analysis

A collaborative web application for annotating gameplay videos, based on biometric time series data. This tool was developed as part of my <a href="{{ site.url }}/publications/schaekermann_bachelorsthesis_2014.pdf" target="_blank">bachelor thesis</a> at Salzburg University of Applied Sciences.

## Implicit Surface Modeling for 3D Printing

This project is an experimental prototype for the real-time customization and animation of 3D-printable objects. It makes use of implicit surfaces, raymarching and the isosurface extraction algorithm Marching Cubes. The current version of the prototype only works on Mac OS X and iOS devices.

## 3D Simulation of an Endocrine System

During my medical studies at the University of Marburg, I created this project as part of an elective course on "Simulation Methods in Physiology and Neurobiology". It is a real-time 3D simulation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis" target="_blank">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis</a>, a part of the human neuro-endocrine system, that controls reactions to stress and regulates many body processes, including digestion, the immune system, mood and emotions, sexuality, and energy storage and expenditure.
