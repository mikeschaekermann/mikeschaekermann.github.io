# Research

My research is located at the intersection of **human-computer interaction**, **machine learning** and **medicine**. In the past, I have focused on developing methods to capture and utilize the structure of <a href="https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/16284" target="_blank">**ambiguous classification**</a> problems for human-centered machine learning and human-AI interaction.
